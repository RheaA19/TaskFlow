React Group Project: TaskFlow

Project Scope
The goal is to build a simple, responsive Task Management Application called TaskFlow. This project
must be built entirely using React Functional Components, manage its data using Hooks (specifically
useState and potentially useEffect), implement Routing for distinct application views, and be styled
efficiently using Bootstrap. The entire development process must utilize GitHub for version control and
collaborative development.
